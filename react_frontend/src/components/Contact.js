            <h5> Hello! I'm Michael, a recent grad based in Central Texas with a passion for challenges and solving problems using technology. 
                    I started learning to code about a year ago and found loving the process that went into writing even the smallest programs. 
                    I strive to always grow and improve, and learn as much as I can.

                    I am working on developing applications that provide intuitive user interfaces paired with efficient backend architecture.
